### Circular Bar Plot (basic)
## Note: Need to delete every 2nd and 3rd row from df2c_factor 
## to create circular bar plot with only "unique observations"
## NOT multiplied by three because 'purpose' included (e.g., see df2c_factor id)
## IMPORTANT NOTE: ylim() is importatn for circular bar plot because scale is off if not applied correctly


# every 3rd row
df2c_factor %>%
    filter(row_number() %% 3 != 1) -> df2d

# delete every EVEN row (every 2nd row)
df2d %>%
    filter(row_number() %% 2 != 0) -> df2d

# plot
circle_bar <- ggplot(data = df2d, aes(x=countries, y=number_recipient, fill=scholarship_provider))

### Ridgeline Plot
library(ggridges)

# plot
